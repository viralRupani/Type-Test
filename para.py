            '"The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies '
            'were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors '
            'that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving '
            'them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter." To quote '
            'doctoral candidate Anna Feit: "We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, '
            'performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used '
            '6 fingers on average" (Wikipedia)',
            'The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps his or her eyes '
            'on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, '
            'where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause '
            'carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the '
            'waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, '
            'and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; '
            'fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.',
            'Words per minute (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in recruitment. For the purposes of '
            'WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, "brown" counts as '
            'one word, but "accounted" counts as two. The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are '
            'that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an Afrikaans-speaking '
            'operator in Cape Town can be compared with a French-speaking operator in Paris. (Wikipedia)',
